# CHANLLENGE 2 - STOCK DATA ANALYSIS WITH VBA 

# Overview:
Welcome to the Challenge 2 repository! This project involves an Excel file containing a database of stocks and a VBA script for analyzing and summarizing key metrics. The script calculates the yearly change, percentage change per year, and total volume for each stock.

Project Components:
StockData.xlsx: The Excel file contains the dataset of stocks. Each sheet represents a different year, with columns for The name of the stock, Date, Open Price, High Price, Low Price, Close Price, and Volume.

VBA Script - StockAnalysis.vba:

# Functionality:

#Calculates the yearly change  from the opening    price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price for each stock.
#Determines the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
#Computes the total volume of each stock.

#How to Run:
Open the Excel file (StockData.xlsx).
Enable macros if prompted.
Run the VBA script (Alt + F8), choose "StockAnalysis" macro, and execute.
View the output in the Excel file.

Ensure macros are enabled in Excel.
Save a backup of StockData.xlsx before running the script.


Once the script completes, check the results in the Excel file.
Each stock sheet will now include columns for Yearly Change, Percentage Change, and Total Volume.
