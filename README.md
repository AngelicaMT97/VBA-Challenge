# CHANLLENGE 2 - STOCK DATA ANALYSIS WITH VBA 

# Overview:

Welcome to the Challenge 2 repository! This project focuses on utilizing VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to analyze stock data. The primary goal is to develop a VBA script that calculates the yearly change, percentage change per year, and the total volume of a given stock.

# Functionality:

#Calculates the yearly change  from the opening    price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price for each stock.
#Determines the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
#Computes the total volume of each stock.

#How to Run:
Open the Excel file (multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx).
Enable macros if prompted.
Paste the code on the VBA script (Alt + F8), and run it.
View the output in the Excel file.

Ensure macros are enabled in Excel.

Once the script completes, check the results in the Excel file.
Each stock sheet will now include columns for Yearly Change, Percentage Change, and Total Volume.
